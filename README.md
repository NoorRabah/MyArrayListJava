# ðŸ“š MyArrayList Java Project

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This Java project provides a custom class named `MyArrayList<T>` that simulates the behavior of Java's built-in `ArrayList`.

It supports basic operations such as:
- Adding elements with automatic resizing
- Copying the list
- Merging two lists without duplicates
- Accessing elements by index
- Checking if an element exists
- Printing the list in a formatted way

The second class `Data3maliAss2` contains the `main` method, where the functionality of `MyArrayList` is demonstrated using test data and printed output.
